# TransactionHistory
Read my csv credit statements and categorize my spending. I felt there was no nice way of getting this information without some sort of third party software. Alas I decided to just create my own tools and make a visualization tool to see all of my spending and categorize it! I had to filter out the csv to only track my spending and not my income.
